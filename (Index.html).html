I think I have been impacted by Cryptology in general terms. For example, when using online websites, my 
information is secure and protected using encryption so others cannot see and steal my information such as passwords. I believe Cryptology is positive.
 many wars have ended in better conditions for others depending on which side won. As an example, Cryptologists aided the Allied Powers in ending WW2 when Nazi Germany and
  later Japan surrendered. This may have taken much longer without Cryptology. Our everyday life is often surrounded by Cryptology as well, 
  to keep information secure, whether using credit cards, shopping, or simply signing in to your email.
