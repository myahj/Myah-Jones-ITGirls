 <h1>Myah Jones' Biography</h1>
 <p>
Hi! My name is Myah Jones, I will be going into 10th grade, and I live in Upstate NY (Syracuse). 
I have recently (maybe a year ago) become interested in Technology, and how it interacts with Science (Ex- Biotechnology). Along with many other things, I am very interested
 in exactly what makes electronic devices work and what they are made up of. I enjoy dancing, cooking, writting, reading books and articles, as well as watching TV and 
 youtube. Um yea that's pretty much it, and I'm looking forward to class! Hope you all are doing alright!
I had no idea how to word this before, but I am primarily interested in Biotechnology, and Computer Programming, along with the actual buidling of electronic devices, if that makes more sense.
